public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few

without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

vulnerabilities :

  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)

  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'

    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)

  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

remote host is prior to 2.2.12. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - A heap-based buffer underwrite flaw exists in the
    function 'apr_strmatch_precompile()' in the bundled copy
    of the APR-util library, which could be triggered when
    parsing configuration data to crash the daemon.
    (CVE-2009-0023)

  - A flaw in the mod_proxy_ajp module in version 2.2.11
    only may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
    response data intended for a client that sent an
    earlier POST request with no request body.
    (CVE-2009-1191)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

  - There is an off-by-one overflow in the function
    'apr_brigade_vprintf()' in the bundled copy of the
    APR-util library in the way it handles a variable list
    of arguments, which could be leveraged on big-endian
    platforms to perform information disclosure or denial
    of service attacks. (CVE-2009-1956)

  - A flaw in the mod_proxy_ajp module in version 2.2.11
    only may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
    response data intended for a client that sent an
    earlier POST request with no request body.
    (CVE-2009-1191)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

    when computing the hash values for storage in a hash 
    table.  (CVE-2011-4885)
   
  - An integer overflow exists in the exif_process_IFD_TAG 
    function in exif.c that can allow a remote attacker to 
    read arbitrary memory locations or cause a denial of 
    service condition.  This vulnerability only affects PHP 
    5.4.0beta2 on 32-bit platforms. (CVE-2011-4566)

  - Calls to libxslt are not restricted via
    xsltSetSecurityPrefs(), which could allow an attacker
    to create or overwrite files, resulting in arbitrary
    code execution. (CVE-2012-0057)

  - An error exists in the function 'tidy_diagnose' that
    can allow an attacker to cause the application to 
    dereference a NULL pointer. This causes the application
    to crash. (CVE-2012-0781)

  - The 'PDORow' implementation contains an error that can
    cause application crashes when interacting with the 
    session feature. (CVE-2012-0788)

  - An error exists in the timezone handling such that

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zd. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3
    option isn't enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is
    received. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)

  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not
    properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This
    allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with
    dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote
    attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)

  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA
    certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This
    allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward
    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zd. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3
    option isn't enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is
    received. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)

  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not
    properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This
    allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with
    dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote
    attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)

  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA
    certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This
    allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward
    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zd. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3
    option isn't enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is
    received. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)

  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not
    properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This
    allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with
    dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote
    attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)

  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA
    certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This
    allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward
    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)","Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8zd or later.","https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-0.9.8-notes.html

    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A key disclosure vulnerability exists in the SSLv2
    implementation in the get_client_master_key() function
    due to the acceptance of a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
    CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher. A

    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A key disclosure vulnerability exists in the SSLv2
    implementation in the get_client_master_key() function
    due to the acceptance of a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
    CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to determine
    the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by
    leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
    (CVE-2016-0703)
   
  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    SSLv2 implementation in the get_client_master_key()
    function due to incorrectly overwriting MASTER-KEY bytes
    during use of export cipher suites. A remote attacker
    can exploit this to create a Bleichenbacher oracle.

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A key disclosure vulnerability exists in the SSLv2
    implementation in the get_client_master_key() function
    due to the acceptance of a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
    CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to determine
    the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by
    leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
    (CVE-2016-0703)
   
  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    SSLv2 implementation in the get_client_master_key()
    function due to incorrectly overwriting MASTER-KEY bytes
    during use of export cipher suites. A remote attacker
    can exploit this to create a Bleichenbacher oracle.

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zf. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A key disclosure vulnerability exists in the SSLv2
    implementation in the get_client_master_key() function
    due to the acceptance of a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
    CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to determine
    the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by
    leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
    (CVE-2016-0703)
   
  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    SSLv2 implementation in the get_client_master_key()
    function due to incorrectly overwriting MASTER-KEY bytes
    during use of export cipher suites. A remote attacker
    can exploit this to create a Bleichenbacher oracle.

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zf. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A key disclosure vulnerability exists in the SSLv2
    implementation in the get_client_master_key() function
    due to the acceptance of a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
    CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to determine
    the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by
    leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
    (CVE-2016-0703)
   
  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    SSLv2 implementation in the get_client_master_key()
    function due to incorrectly overwriting MASTER-KEY bytes

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

"78479","CVE-2014-3566","4.3","Medium","91.228.89.36","tcp","443","SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)","It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host
with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.
