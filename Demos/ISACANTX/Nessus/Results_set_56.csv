public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is not supported on the server. Mitigating this

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

remote attacker to potentially decrypt captured TLS traffic.","The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a
vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding
oracle attack known as DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and
Weakened eNcryption). This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the
Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows
captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can
exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously
captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of
specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same
private key.","Disable SSLv2 and export grade cryptography cipher suites. Ensure that
private keys are not used anywhere with server software that supports
SSLv2 connections.","https://drownattack.com/

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.
