  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)

  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2014-8626)","Upgrade to PHP version 5.2.8 or later.

Note that version 5.2.7 has been removed from distribution because of
a regression in that version that results in the 'magic_quotes_gpc'

    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a

    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the

back"" to SSLv3.
