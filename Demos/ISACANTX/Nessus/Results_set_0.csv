  - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced in the function
    '_zip_name_locate()' when processing empty archives and
    can lead to application crashes or code execution.
    Exploitation requires the 'ZIPARCHIVE::FL_UNCHANGED'
    setting to be in use. (CVE-2011-0421)

  - A variable casting error exists in the Exif extention,
    which can allow denial of service attacks when handling
    crafted 'Image File Directory' (IFD) header values in
    the PHP function 'exif_read_data()'. Exploitation
    requires a 64bit system and a config setting
    'memory_limit' above 4GB or unlimited. (CVE-2011-0708)

  - An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the
    implementation of the PHP function 'shmop_read()' and
    can allow arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2011-1092)

  - Errors exist in the file 'phar/phar_object.c' in which
    calls to 'zend_throw_exception_ex()' pass data as a
    string format parameter. This can lead to memory
    corruption when handling PHP archives (phar).
    (CVE-2011-1153)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the C function
    'xbuf_format_converter' when the PHP configuration value
    for 'precision' is set to a large value and can lead to
    application crashes. (CVE-2011-1464)

  - An integer overflow error exists in the C function
    'SdnToJulian()' in the Calendar extension and can lead
    to application crashes. (CVE-2011-1466)

  - An unspecified error exists in the implementation of
    the PHP function 'numfmt_set_symbol()' and PHP method
    'NumberFormatter::setSymbol()' in the Intl extension.
    This error can lead to application crashes.
    (CVE-2011-1467)

  - Multiple memory leaks exist in the OpenSSL extension
    in the PHP functions 'openssl_encrypt' and
    'openssl_decrypt'. (CVE-2011-1468)

  - An unspecified error exists in the Streams component
    when accessing FTP URLs with an HTTP proxy.
    (CVE-2011-1469)

  - An integer signedness error and an unspecified error
    exist in the Zip extension and can lead to denial of
    service via certain ziparchive streams. (CVE-2011-1470,
    CVE-2011-1471)

execute arbitrary code.  In vulnerable configurations, PHP treats
certain query string parameters as command line arguments including
switches such as '-s', '-d', and '-c'.

CGI-based configurations.  Apache with 'mod_php' is not an exploitable
configuration.","Upgrade to PHP version 5.3.12 / 5.4.2 or later.  A 'mod_rewrite'

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority.

valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize.

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

following vulnerabilities :

  - A heap-based buffer underwrite flaw exists in the
    function 'apr_strmatch_precompile()' in the bundled copy
    of the APR-util library, which could be triggered when
    parsing configuration data to crash the daemon.
    (CVE-2009-0023)

  - A flaw in the mod_proxy_ajp module in version 2.2.11
    only may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
    response data intended for a client that sent an
    earlier POST request with no request body.
    (CVE-2009-1191)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

    function 'apr_strmatch_precompile()' in the bundled copy
    of the APR-util library, which could be triggered when
    parsing configuration data to crash the daemon.
    (CVE-2009-0023)

  - A flaw in the mod_proxy_ajp module in version 2.2.11
    only may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
    response data intended for a client that sent an
    earlier POST request with no request body.
    (CVE-2009-1191)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

  - There is an off-by-one overflow in the function
    'apr_brigade_vprintf()' in the bundled copy of the
    APR-util library in the way it handles a variable list
    of arguments, which could be leveraged on big-endian
    platforms to perform information disclosure or denial
    of service attacks. (CVE-2009-1956)

    can lead to application crashes or code execution.
    Exploitation requires the 'ZIPARCHIVE::FL_UNCHANGED'
    setting to be in use. (CVE-2011-0421)

  - A variable casting error exists in the Exif extention,
    which can allow denial of service attacks when handling
    crafted 'Image File Directory' (IFD) header values in
    the PHP function 'exif_read_data()'. Exploitation
    requires a 64bit system and a config setting
    'memory_limit' above 4GB or unlimited. (CVE-2011-0708)

  - An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the
    implementation of the PHP function 'shmop_read()' and
    can allow arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2011-1092)

  - Errors exist in the file 'phar/phar_object.c' in which
    calls to 'zend_throw_exception_ex()' pass data as a
    string format parameter. This can lead to memory
    corruption when handling PHP archives (phar).
    (CVE-2011-1153)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the C function
    'xbuf_format_converter' when the PHP configuration value
    for 'precision' is set to a large value and can lead to
    application crashes. (CVE-2011-1464)

following vulnerabilities :

  - An flaw exists within the 'mod_headers' module which
    allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.
    This is done by placing a header in the trailer portion
    of data being sent using chunked transfer encoding.

  - An flaw exists within the 'mod_deflate' module when
    handling highly compressed bodies. Using a specially
    crafted request, a remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service by exhausting memory and CPU
    resources. (CVE-2014-0118)

  - The 'mod_status' module contains a race condition that
    can be triggered when handling the scoreboard. A remote
