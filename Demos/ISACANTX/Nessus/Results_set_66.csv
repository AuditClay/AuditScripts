different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize.

Some browser SSL implementations may reject keys less than 2048 bits
after January 1, 2014. Additionally, some SSL certificate vendors may
revoke certificates less than 2048 bits before January 1, 2014.

Note that Nessus will not flag root certificates with RSA keys less
than 2048 bits if they were issued prior to December 31, 2010, as the
standard considers them exempt.","Replace the certificate in the chain with the RSA key less than 2048
bits in length with a longer key, and reissue any certificates signed
by the old certificate.","https://www.cabforum.org/Baseline_Requirements_V1.pdf","

sent by the remote host, but contain RSA keys that are considered
to be weak :
