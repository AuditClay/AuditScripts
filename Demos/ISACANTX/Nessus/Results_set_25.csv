unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","Port 80 was detected as being open but is now unresponsive

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","","

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the

vulnerabilities :

  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE

    (CVE-2008-2371)

  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function

    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zd. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3
    option isn't enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is
    received. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)

  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not
    properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This
    allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with
    dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote
    attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)

  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA
    certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This
    allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward
    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)","Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8zd or later.","https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-0.9.8-notes.html

    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and

OpenSSL 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8zf. The OpenSSL library is, therefore,
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A key disclosure vulnerability exists in the SSLv2
    implementation in the get_client_master_key() function
    due to the acceptance of a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY
    CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to determine
    the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by
    leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
    (CVE-2016-0703)
   
  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    SSLv2 implementation in the get_client_master_key()
