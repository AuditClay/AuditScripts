with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user

different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize.

vulnerabilities related to the included OpenSSL library :

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker

    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A flaw exists in the DTLSv1_listen() function due to
    state being preserved in the SSL object from one
    invocation to the next. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via crafted DTLS traffic, to cause a segmentation
    fault, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0207)

  - A flaw exists in the rsa_item_verify() function due to
    improper implementation of ASN.1 signature verification.
    A remote attacker can exploit this, via an ASN.1
    signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and invalid
    parameters, to cause a NULL pointer dereference,
    resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0208)

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_client_hello() function due to
    improper validation of a PRNG seed before proceeding
    with a handshake, resulting in insufficient entropy and
    predictable output. This allows a man-in-the-middle
    attacker to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
    via a brute-force attack, resulting in the disclosure of
    sensitive information. (CVE-2015-0285)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the

    to cause a segmentation fault or memory corruption,
    resulting in a denial of service or possibly the
    execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0292)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_get_client_key_exchange()
    function when client authentication and an ephemeral
    Diffie-Hellman ciphersuite are enabled. This allows a
    remote attacker, via a ClientKeyExchange message with a
    length of zero, to cause a denial of service.

vulnerabilities related to the included OpenSSL library :

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_client_hello() function due to
    improper validation of a PRNG seed before proceeding
    with a handshake, resulting in insufficient entropy and

    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

remote web server is 5.0.x prior to 5.0.13, 6.0.x prior to 6.0.9, or 
6.1.x prior to 6.1.4. It is, therefore, affected by the following 
vulnerabilities related to the included OpenSSL library :

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A flaw exists in the DTLSv1_listen() function due to
    state being preserved in the SSL object from one
    invocation to the next. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via crafted DTLS traffic, to cause a segmentation
    fault, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0207)

  - A flaw exists in the rsa_item_verify() function due to
    improper implementation of ASN.1 signature verification.
    A remote attacker can exploit this, via an ASN.1
    signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and invalid
    parameters, to cause a NULL pointer dereference,
    resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0208)

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_client_hello() function due to
    improper validation of a PRNG seed before proceeding
    with a handshake, resulting in insufficient entropy and
    predictable output. This allows a man-in-the-middle
    attacker to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
    via a brute-force attack, resulting in the disclosure of
    sensitive information. (CVE-2015-0285)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists with the 'multiblock' feature in the
    ssl3_write_bytes() function due to improper handling of
    certain non-blocking I/O cases. This allows a remote
    attacker to cause failed connections or a segmentation
    fault, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0290)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when handling
    clients attempting to renegotiate using an invalid
    signature algorithm extension. A remote attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0291)

  - An integer underflow condition exists in the
    EVP_DecodeUpdate() function due to improper validation
    of base64 encoded input when decoding. This allows a
    remote attacker, using maliciously crafted base64 data,
    to cause a segmentation fault or memory corruption,
    resulting in a denial of service or possibly the
    execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0292)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_get_client_key_exchange()
    function when client authentication and an ephemeral
    Diffie-Hellman ciphersuite are enabled. This allows a
    remote attacker, via a ClientKeyExchange message with a
    length of zero, to cause a denial of service.

    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A flaw exists in the DTLSv1_listen() function due to
    state being preserved in the SSL object from one
    invocation to the next. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via crafted DTLS traffic, to cause a segmentation
    fault, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0207)

  - A flaw exists in the rsa_item_verify() function due to
    improper implementation of ASN.1 signature verification.
    A remote attacker can exploit this, via an ASN.1
    signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and invalid
    parameters, to cause a NULL pointer dereference,
    resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0208)

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_client_hello() function due to
    improper validation of a PRNG seed before proceeding
    with a handshake, resulting in insufficient entropy and
    predictable output. This allows a man-in-the-middle
    attacker to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
    via a brute-force attack, resulting in the disclosure of
    sensitive information. (CVE-2015-0285)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists with the 'multiblock' feature in the
    ssl3_write_bytes() function due to improper handling of
    certain non-blocking I/O cases. This allows a remote
    attacker to cause failed connections or a segmentation
    fault, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0290)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when handling
    clients attempting to renegotiate using an invalid
    signature algorithm extension. A remote attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0291)

  - An integer underflow condition exists in the
    EVP_DecodeUpdate() function due to improper validation
    of base64 encoded input when decoding. This allows a
    remote attacker, using maliciously crafted base64 data,
    to cause a segmentation fault or memory corruption,
    resulting in a denial of service or possibly the
    execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0292)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl3_get_client_key_exchange()
    function when client authentication and an ephemeral
    Diffie-Hellman ciphersuite are enabled. This allows a
    remote attacker, via a ClientKeyExchange message with a
    length of zero, to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-1787)

    an ECParameters structure due to an infinite loop that
    occurs when a specified curve is over a malformed binary
    polynomial field. A remote attacker can exploit this to
    perform a denial of service against any system that
    processes public keys, certificate requests, or
    certificates. This includes TLS clients and TLS servers
    with client authentication enabled. (CVE-2015-1788)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists due to improper
    validation of the content and length of the ASN1_TIME
    string by the X509_cmp_time() function. A remote
    attacker can exploit this, via a malformed certificate
    and CRLs of various sizes, to cause a segmentation
    fault, resulting in a denial of service condition. TLS
    clients that verify CRLs are affected. TLS clients and
    servers with client authentication enabled may be
    affected if they use custom verification callbacks.
    (CVE-2015-1789)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing inner
    'EncryptedContent'. This allows a remote attacker, via
    specially crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs with
    missing content, to cause a denial of service condition
    or other potential unspecified impacts. (CVE-2015-1790)

  - A double-free error exists due to a race condition that
    occurs when a NewSessionTicket is received by a
    multi-threaded client when attempting to reuse a
    previous ticket. (CVE-2015-1791)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the CMS code
    due to an infinite loop that occurs when verifying a
    signedData message. A remote attacker can exploit this
    to cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2015-1792)

  - A certificate validation bypass vulnerability exists due
    to a flaw in the X509_verify_cert() function in file
    x509_vfy.c, which occurs when locating alternate
    certificate chains whenever the first attempt to build
    such a chain fails. A remote attacker can exploit this,
    by using a valid leaf certificate as a certificate
    authority (CA), to issue invalid certificates that will
    bypass authentication. (CVE-2015-1793)

Additionally, a cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Splunk
Enterprise due to improper validation of user-supplied input before
returning it to users. An attacker can exploit this, via a crafted
request, to execute arbitrary script code. (VulnDB 126171)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead
relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","Upgrade to Splunk Enterprise 5.0.14 / 6.0.10 / 6.1.9 / 6.2.5 or later,

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its self-reported version number, the version of Splunk
Enterprise hosted on the remote web server is 5.0.x, 6.0.x prior to
6.0.12, 6.1.x prior to 6.1.11, 6.2.x prior to 6.2.11, 6.3.x prior to
6.3.6, or 6.4.x prior to 6.4.2; or else it is Splunk Light version
6.4.x prior to 6.4.2. It is, therefore, affected by the following
vulnerabilities :

  - An integer signedness error exists in libarchive in the
    archive_write_zip_data() function within file
    archive_write_set_format_zip.c due to improper
    conversion between unsigned and signed integer types
    when running on 64-bit CPUs. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this to cause a buffer overflow,
    resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2013-0211)

  - A path traversal vulnerability exists in libarchive in
    the bsdcpio() function within file in cpio/cpio.c due to
    improper sanitization of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    a specially crafted path in an archive, to write to
    arbitrary files. (CVE-2015-2304)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in
    libarchive in the zip_read_mac_metadata() function
    within file archive_read_support_format_zip.c due to
    improper sanitization of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    specially crafted entry-size values in a ZIP archive, to
    cause a denial of service condition or the execution of
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1541)

  - Multiple flaws exist in the OpenSSL library in the
    aesni_cbc_hmac_sha1_cipher() function in file
    crypto/evp/e_aes_cbc_hmac_sha1.c and the
    aesni_cbc_hmac_sha256_cipher() function in file
    crypto/evp/e_aes_cbc_hmac_sha256.c that are triggered
    when the connection uses an AES-CBC cipher and AES-NI
    is supported by the server. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    can exploit these to conduct a padding oracle attack,
    resulting in the ability to decrypt the network traffic.
    (CVE-2016-2107)

  - An unspecified cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    exists due to improper validation of user-supplied
    input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a specially crafted request, to execute
    arbitrary script code in the user's browser session.
    (VulnDB 142260)

  - An unspecified cross-site redirection vulnerability
    exists due to improper validation of user-supplied
    input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted
    web link, to redirect the browser to an arbitrary
    website of the attacker's own choosing. (VulnDB 142261)

Note that Splunk Enterprise 5.0.x will not be patched for OpenSSL
issues, and it is recommended you upgrade to the latest version.

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead
relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to version 6.0.12 / 6.1.11 / 6.2.11 /

public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three
different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below
which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

"78479","CVE-2014-3566","4.3","Medium","141.10.69.198","tcp","443","SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)","It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host
with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.
